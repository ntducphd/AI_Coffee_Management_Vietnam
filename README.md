# ☕️ AI_Coffee_Management_Vietnam

## 📘 Introduction

Vietnam is one of the world's leading coffee producers, especially renowned for **Robusta**. However, smallholder farmers in regions like **Đắk Lắk** face growing challenges from climate change, pests, yield instability, and limited access to precision agriculture. This project aims to leverage **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Remote Sensing**, and **Machine Learning (ML)** to support sustainable coffee production in Vietnam.

We propose a comprehensive, scalable framework for **AI-assisted coffee management**, focusing on:

- 🗺️ **Mapping** coffee plantations using satellite imagery  
- 📡 **Monitoring** biophysical indicators (e.g., NDVI, phenology, water stress)  
- 📊 **Modeling** yield and climate risks  
- 🧭 **Decision support** for farmers and agricultural planners  

This open-source project brings together advanced analytics with ground-level impact, empowering stakeholders with spatial insights and automation for better decision-making.
